### Reading Data from APIs
    
I created a vignette on Working with APIs in R. You can see my work here:

[Reading Data from APIs](https://hcopley.github.io/ST558_Project_2/)

You can also find my github repo [here](https://github.com/hcopley/ST558_Project_2) 



This was a fun and interesting project. I used the National Parks Service API in this example to explore campground data. In the vignette, I walk through an example of creating functions to gather data from the API, practice doing just that, and finish up with some exploratory analysis. I found that most national parks campgrounds are very affordable and offer a plethora of activities. I found that the National Park in North Carolina that has both the most activies and the most campgrounds is one that I have yet to explore! Time to go camping!
    
I learned alot through this project, the API itself offers quite alot of data. I initially wanted to look at some of the accessibility data available. However I now know that many of these variables such as wheelchair accessibility are free text values and would need more cleaning or text analysis to do any real qualitative research. What I was able to explore was cost, the number and range of activities offered, and types of campgrounds.

## What is being a Data Scientist about?  

Data Science is all about the use of machine learning and statistical methods and models to answer questions, predict a possible outcome, or understand complex systems. 

## Knowledge and Skill Areas

Data Scientist need to have skills from various domains including math and statistics of course, but also programming, computer science, domain and business expertise, data manipulation, machine learning, and data visualization. 

## Differences and Similarities between Statisticians and Data Scientists

The primary differences between data scientists and statisticians revolve around the kinds of projects they tackle, the methodologies they use, and the goal in mind. Statisticians often work under specific assumptions about data, such as the type of distribution or independence of observations. Statisticians do use non-parametric methods when these assumptions don't hold but, data scientists frequently use machine learning techniques like Random Forests and neural networks, which don't operate under such strict assumptions. 

Statisticians work primarily on answering specific questions from a sample of data that can be generalized to a larger population. Data scientists may also use data to answer questions but they may use large quantities of data from a production environment, and their models may be employed back into that production environment in real time to predict future outcomes or solve a problem. 

While both professions may employ the same methods at times, their objectives are usually different. A statistician, using a linear model, may aim to understand relationships between different groups. A data scientist might use the same model but with a focus on making predictions. Thus, similar tools can serve different ends depending on the practitioner's goals.

Another distinction lies in the preparatory stages. Statisticians usually invest a substantial amount of time in planning the experimental design before even collecting the data. Data scientists, on the other hand, are often working with existing data that might not be in an optimal format, requiring them to spend more time on combining data sets, manipulating the data, reshaping, and cleaning. 

## How I Describe Myself

I'd place myself somewhere in the middle of the continuum of statistician and data scientist, leaning more towards the data science end. My work often deals with production data, which is usually collected before I was ever asked to be involved and without future experiments or analyses in mind. This approach is known as observational research in statistics but is more common among data science practitioners. The data usually resides in one or multiple databases or even online sources, and it's generally not collected with an experimental design in focus. I typically need to do quite a bit of work to bring disparate tables or data sources together, and to manipulate and clean the data.  

While I occasionally conduct hypothesis testing on a sample, I more commonly analyze the complete data set. I use machine learning techniques like clustering to identify natural groups, summary statistics to grasp the central tendency and distribution, and predictive methods through either parametric or non-parametric approaches. Unlike statisticians, who primarily aim to answer specific questions, my role often involves problem-solving in addition to question-answering. I also spend a fair bit of time visualizing data to help explain both my methods and the data to others who may not have the same level of understanding of statistics or data science.
